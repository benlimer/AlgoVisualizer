# AlgoVisualizer

Welcome to AlgoVisualizer! I developed this app because I was fascinated by the elegance of different algorithms and I wanted to further help others (and myself) better understand them by visualizing what's actually happening. I hope you have as much fun with the tool as I had building it!
